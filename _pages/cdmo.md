## Multi-Courier Problem (MCP) Optimization

![](../images/cdmo.png)

Developed and compared four models—Constraint Programming (CP), Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)—to optimize courier assignment and routing for minimizing total travel distance. Utilized standard Vehicle Routing Problem methodologies, including successor matrix and predecessor array approaches. Achieved optimal solutions for small-scale instances (e.g. 10 couriers, 13 instances) and identified limitations in SAT and SMT for larger instances. Demonstrated proficiency in mathematical modeling, problem-solving, and optimization techniques.
