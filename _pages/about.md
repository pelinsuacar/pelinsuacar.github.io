      In addition to my work in AI, I have hands-on experience in data engineering, where I have worked with big data models, prepared and optimized data pipelines for AI analysis, and ensured data consistency and reliability across large-scale systems. My ability to bridge AI and data engineering allows me to develop impactful, end-to-end solutions that address real-world challenges effectively.
