    <h1 style="text-align: center;">About</h1>

    I am a passionate AI engineer with a master’s degree in artificial intelligence from the University of Bologna and a bachelor’s in electrical and electronics engineering, with research interests in computer vision and natural language processing.

    In addition to my work in AI, I have hands-on experience in data engineering, where I have worked with big data models, prepared and optimized data pipelines for AI analysis, and ensured data consistency and reliability across large-scale systems. My ability to bridge AI and data engineering allows me to develop impactful, end-to-end solutions that address real-world challenges effectively.
