              <h4>CNH INDUSTRIAL BELGIUM NV · Mar 2024 – Dec 2024</h4>
              <p>Conducted research on Zero-Shot and Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (ZSOD and OSD) for agricultural applications, focusing on crop kernel detection to enable real-time grain loss assessment. Evaluated state-of-the-art models (OWLv2 and YOLO-World) using advanced query embedding techniques (CLIP, DINOv2) and prompt tuning, analyzing the impact of pre-processing strategies and expanded datasets on detection performance. This work highlights key challenges and advancements in adapting ZSOD models for domain-specific agricultural systems.</p>
